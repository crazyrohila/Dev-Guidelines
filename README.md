**Always Remember**
-------------------

* Don't try to prematurely optimize your code;
  keep it readable and understandable.

* All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it,
  even when many people are contributing to it.

* Strictly enforce the agreed-upon style.

* Whatever you do, you should be able to explain the reason to other person.

* If it makes sense, if it feels right, do it. Code is just a means, not an end.


**Common Practices**
--------------------

* Always use 2 spaces for indentation

* Strings longer than 80 characters should be written across
  multiple lines using string concatenation.

* Use braces with all multi-line blocks.

* Place 1 space before the leading brace.

* Set off operators with spaces.

* No trailing white spaces.

* Be descriptive with your naming for variables and functions.

* Comment as much as you can.

* Use `/* ... */` for multi-line comments and `//` for single line comments.

* Configure your editor according to these standards.
